# Meshpresso â˜• 
_A **Meshtastic Client** (poorly) written in **Java**_
>Or in other words, yet another project where I forget to consider how hard it would actually be to make this thing.

>This is gonna be the **first half** of an even more stupid project later on. Stay tuned.

## The goal
* a (hopefully) functional Meshtastic client that'll connect to a node like any other client would
* a somewhat solid foundation to work from when the time for second half of the project comes

## Why do this to yourself?
* because I want to see if I can
* because it was ***the reasonable thing to do*** ~~in order to do ***the unreasonable part of this project*** properly later on~~ :3
* because _wouldn't it be cool?
